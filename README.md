# libGDX Bit Masking Auto Tile Implementation

This is a java Bit Masking implementation in [libGDX] based on a [tutorial] by [Sonny Bone].

This project uses [Lombok] getters and setters to make our life easier.
You may need to install a plugin in your IDE to use it properly.

## What is BitMasking Auto Tiling?
"Tile bitmasking is a method for automatically selecting the appropriate sprite from a defined tileset. This allows you to place a generic placeholder tile everywhere you want a particular type of terrain to appear instead of hand placing a potentially enormous selection of various tiles." - [Sonny Bone]
